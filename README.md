# Question
Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP).
The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose in mind. Answer the question
“why will the user open this app for a second time?” as part of the design process. What makes your
app better than the others available offering the same function?
The application can be a game (UNITY is acceptable with C# scripting) or an interactive information
app. What the app does is up to you. You can have a single page app, or one with many pages – that
is a choice. 

# Overview
I created a UWP application for discovering new restaurants close by. This app incorporates elements such as Sound, Device Rotation. A Camera element to take pictures for social media purposes such as taking photos of your food. A Geolocation element to show you where you are and a binding table to show you what restaurants are close by. I had problems with displaying the information from the database I created (restaurantsdb.db3).
